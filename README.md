I. Synopsis
------------
This program simulates a consensus algorithm of four agents connected via a directed
strongly connected and weight balanced graph with an adjacency matrix given by 
            
	G = [0 1 0 1; 1 0 1 0; 0 1 0 1; 1 0 1 0]
    
where the graphs are only able to communicate at stocastically determined isolated events.
